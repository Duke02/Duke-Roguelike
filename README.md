# Duke Roguelike

A roguelike that will likely flop around a bit and never get updated unless I want to do so. 
Uses SFML.

## TODO 
* Continue developing FileLogger class after a prototype is made.
    * An actual working game is needed before a logging function. 
* The actual game.
* Whatever arises!
